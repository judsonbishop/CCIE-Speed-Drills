Configure gateway redundancy for VLAN 12 on interface fa0/1.12 between R1 and R2.
The redundant addresses should be 12.0.0.1 and 12.0.0.2 within the single
redundancy group 12.  Use ip address 12.0.0.XX as the primary address for the 
interface.  Use the protocol that uses multicast group 224.0.0.18
for information exchange.  Make R1 the preferred gateway address and use
the authentication string AUTH.  The routers should wait 10 seconds before 
assuming master status and use an advertising interval of 2 that is set on
router R1.
